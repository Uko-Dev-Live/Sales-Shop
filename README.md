# Sales-Shop
Program Algorithm

A program algorithm for this shop.
 
 The program or programs must include appropriate prompts for the entry of data; data must be validated on entry.
  Error messages and other output need to be set out clearly and understandably.
  All arrays, variables, constants and other identifiers must have meaningful names.
 
Complete these three tasks.
 
Task 1 – Setting up the system.
Write a program to:
  use appropriate data structures to store the item code, description and price information for the mobile devices, SIM cards and accessories;
  allow the customer to choose a specific phone or tablet;
  allow phone customers to choose whether the phone will be SIM Free or Pay As You Go;
  allow the customer to choose a standard or luxury case;
  allow the customer to choose the chargers required (none, one or both may be purchased);
  calculate the total price of this transaction;
  output a list of the items purchased and the total price.
 
Task 2 – Allow a customer to order multiple mobile devices. Extend Task 1 to:
  offer the customer the opportunity to purchase an additional mobile device;
  if required, perform bulleted steps 2 to 7 of Task 1 for each additional mobile device and calculate a running total for the customer;
  once no further devices are required, output the total the customer will need to pay.
 
Task 3 – Offering discounts.
Extend the program to allow a discount of 10% off the price of every additional phone or tablet purchased. Output the new total the customer will need to pay and the amount of money saved.
